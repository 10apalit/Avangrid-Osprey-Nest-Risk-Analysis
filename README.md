# Avangrid-Osprey-Nest-Risk-Analysis

Avangrid's objective is the utilization of data to enhance grid dependability, mitigate Osprey-related outages on electric poles, and support Osprey population health through the installation of alternative bird boxes in high-risk nesting areas. This project aims to identify regions within the Avangrid service territory with the highest Osprey population, pinpoint electric poles prone to Osprey nesting, and visualize potential locations for alternative Osprey nesting. Two approaches were explored for identifying susceptible electric poles: spatial autocorrelation and a rule-based model considering Osprey nesting preferences, particularly their inclination to nest near water while avoiding clustering. For visualization, an interactive Streamlit dashboard was developed, allowing users to comprehend outage incidents in the Avangrid service territory and observe targeted mitigation efforts to reduce Osprey-related outages.
